# 100 Days of Code - Round 3

## Day 1
### Monday 4 February 2019 

#### Review / Learn:
* Watched a couple of videos on brand design by Philip VanDusen, [Trends in Graphic Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM7XB0oUP7k) and [9 Brand Design Elements Your Brand Must Have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB57Pc1W6Ys).
* Listened to Syntax podcasts about [defunct web technologies](https://syntax.fm/show/103/hasty-treat-where-are-they-now-part-2), broading my awareness of legacy technologies I might come across.

#### Project:
* Researched portfolios, making a list of interesting examples in Evernote for future reference
* Continued to work on design for front page on new portfolio site using Adobe XD

#### Thoughts:
At the start of today, I wasn't 100% set on starting up 100 days of code again but now it seems I'm going to! Past two efforts have only been successful on my own terms (since I have missed something like 15 days each time). I'm going to try and cut that down this time.

I'm really pleased with the design work I've done on my portfolio today, building an introduction, skills, projects and contact section for the front page. Made some radical changes to the layout and made a real effort to ensure colour scheme is consistent across all page elements.

## Day 2
### Tuesday 5 February 2019 

#### Review / Learn:
* Listened to Syntax podcast about [CSS Layout](https://syntax.fm/show/104/css-layout), reviewing the basics including position, viewport units, responsive design. **Investigate**: viewport units vmin and vmax.
* Re-listened to Shoptalk podcast - [Dan Mall on Building a Portfolio](https://shoptalkshow.com/episodes/329-dan-mall-building-portfolio/)
* Learnt how to use SkyFonts to install Google Fonts on to desktop; installed fonts for portfolio project
* Read about web font sizing guidelines [here](https://learnui.design/blog/mobile-desktop-website-font-size-guidelines.html) on the Learn UI Design Blog.
* Started the Advanced CSS and Sass course on Udemy, beginning the first project, a website called Natours. Worked on creating the header section, which involved creating a background with an image, a gradient overlay and a 'wedge' effect with an angled side. Centring the title achieved using absolute positioning, defining top and left properties using percentages and then using transform: translate(-50%, -50%).

#### Project:
* Finished some minor details of portfolio front page design, tweaking colours. 
* Created complete front page design of portfolio for smaller viewports.
* Updated all fonts to Roboto / Montserrat
* Started work on portfolio projects page design

#### Thoughts:
Made some good progress on portfolio design - I was pleased that I got the fonts sorted out and some more fine-tuning of colours. I really want to push on with this and get the design finished as soon as humanly possible. Next, I will finish the projects page (including creating small-viewport version) and hopefully push on to creating about, skills and contact pages shortly. These should be more straight-forward.

So far, the Advanced CSS and Sass course is promising; the tutor goes into a lot of detail and explains all decisions fully. I would really like to push on with this quickly so I can impliment Sass in my upcoming cafe website project. This is the reason why I have prioritised this course over the React course, which I was loving, but it would be really beneficial to have a new technology I can integrate into a live project.

## Day 3
### Wednesday 6 February 2019 

#### Review / Learn:
* Listened to Syntax podcast about [Tidying up code](https://syntax.fm/show/111/hasty-treat-tidying-up-code); suggestions included removing commented-out code, removing unused CSS (apparently there is a Chrome dev tool that helps with that), organising code, using code formatted such as Prettier or ESLint
* Listen to CodeNewbie podcast [How do I level up?(Ben Orenstein)](https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/how-do-i-level-up)

#### Project:
* Completed design of projects page and created mobile version
* Created design of about page, including larger and smaller viewports
* Created design of skills page, including larger and smaller viewports 

#### Thoughts:
Pushed on through with the portfolio redesign; really pleased with the results. Only the contact page to go and then I'll be ready to start code. Will get through as much of the advanced CSS / Sass course tomorrow - on reflection and discussing with a friend, have decided I should be implementing Sass in my portfolio. Also need to do a review of CSS Grid so I can use that as much as possible for the layout.
