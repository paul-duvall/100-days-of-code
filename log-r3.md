# 100 Days of Code - Round 3

## Day 1
### Monday 4 February 2019 

#### Review / Learn:
* Watched a couple of videos on brand design by Philip VanDusen, [Trends in Graphic Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM7XB0oUP7k) and [9 Brand Design Elements Your Brand Must Have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB57Pc1W6Ys).
* Listened to Syntax podcasts about [defunct web technologies](https://syntax.fm/show/103/hasty-treat-where-are-they-now-part-2), broading my awareness of legacy technologies I might come across.

#### Project:
* Researched portfolios, making a list of interesting examples in Evernote for future reference
* Continued to work on design for front page on new portfolio site using Adobe XD

#### Thoughts:
At the start of today, I wasn't 100% set on starting up 100 days of code again but now it seems I'm going to! Past two efforts have only been successful on my own terms (since I have missed something like 15 days each time). I'm going to try and cut that down this time.

I'm really pleased with the design work I've done on my portfolio today, building an introduction, skills, projects and contact section for the front page. Made some radical changes to the layout and made a real effort to ensure colour scheme is consistent across all page elements.
