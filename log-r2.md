Today's Progress: 
Review / Learn:
- Watched 'The all-powerful frontend developer' Chris Coyier talk

Project:

Thoughts: React thoughts - Some attributes within JSX are named diffrently, for example class becomes className. Most attributes(?) are camelcased. click events can be created using the onClick attribute, which can be set using curly brackets to run a function located elsewhere.
