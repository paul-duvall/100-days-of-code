Today's Progress: Tried to solve an algorithm in FCC and failed. Moved on to first lesson of Javascript 30, and produced a nice version of the drum machine using Javascript.

Thoughts: Algorithm very frustrating today. Even looked at the solution and still struggled to understand what was going on. Switched over to first Javascript 30 lessons which I found really fun. Interesting to work with audio html tag and using javascript to play audio files.
