#### Review / Learn:
* Read article about CSS usits (relative and absolute) [here](https://dev.to/fullstack_to/units-in-css-em-rem-pt-px-vw-vh-vmin-vmax-ex-ch-53l0)

#### Project
* Worked on devLearn, ensuring that the new functionality for adding any number of stages to a project works (that addition stage fields
can be added to the add stage modal, that a new project is added to the UI including all stages and that all projects appear
correctly on refresh).
* Also managed to get all stage fields to show up in the edit item modal, correctly populated with relevant value

### Thoughts
Had a really successful day building on the add stages functionality in devLearn then hit a brick wall with the edit item modal. If
additional stages are added, these then continue to appear if the modal is closed and then opened again for a different task
