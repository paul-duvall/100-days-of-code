### Friday 9 August 2019 

#### Review / Learn:
* Read article about CSS usits (relative and absolute) [here](https://dev.to/fullstack_to/units-in-css-em-rem-pt-px-vw-vh-vmin-vmax-ex-ch-53l0)

#### Project
* Worked on devLearn, ensuring that the new functionality for adding any number of stages to a project works (that addition stage fields
can be added to the add stage modal, that a new project is added to the UI including all stages and that all projects appear
correctly on refresh).
* Also managed to get all stage fields to show up in the edit item modal, correctly populated with relevant value

### Thoughts
Had a really successful day building on the add stages functionality in devLearn then hit a brick wall with the edit item modal. If
additional stages are added, these then continue to appear if the modal is closed and then opened again for a different task

### Wednesday 14 August 2019 

#### Review / Learn:
* Worked through start of next project on Advanced CSS course, getting a refresher on flexbox and setting up html and css for layout

#### Project
* Continued working on DevLearn, fixing bugs in the modal (ensuring that multiple stages, when added, do not reappear if the modal is closed and reopened) and fixing the styling, bringing it inline with bootstrap styles in drive to achieve a more streamline, corporate look (so I have a project that can demo my use of bootstrap).

### Thursday 15 August 2019 

#### Review / Learn:
* Started PHP course and reviewed some basics - variables, calculations

#### Project
* Worked on devLearn:
  * Sorted html issue with the stages fields in the modal, which was affecting the styling
  * Adjusted the styling on the task card to make it more presentable (including moving the edit icon to the right-hand corner)
  * Got the delete button working so that items delete both from the task data-structure and from local storage

### Thoughts
Really pleased with progress made on devLearn - which I think I'll be rebranding as something more generic to do with task management. Having added the functionality to enable users to add multiple stages to a task, I've now added functionality that enables tasks to be deleted. This went very smoothly and was all complete in a little over an hour.

Going forward, there are a number of edge-cases that need to be handled (users can add blank tasks, the styling of newly-added tasks is not the same as those generated from local storage), the priority field needs to be fixed, and functionality needs to be added that enables stages of a task to be marked complete. Hopefully these jobs won't take much longer than hooking up the delete functionality - famous last words - and I'll have the app in a servicable state before too long. Currently, the version deployed to Netlify doesn't work, so I'll need to look at that too.

#### Project
* Continued with devLearn, working on reintegrating the priority field - got this working correctly in the UI and the modal and set it up so that different priorities show as different colours.

### Thoughts
Again, very pleased to continue making steady progress with devLearn. Still plenty to do (add user alerts to the modal to the list!), but getting there!
