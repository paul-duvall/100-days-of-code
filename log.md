### Day 1: 30 April, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Started the 'tribute page' project on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've only recently started coding and very recently gotten into FreeCodeCamp. Enjoyed doing the first project and have posted it on the FreeCodeCamp forum for comments (took some time to comment on other people's first).

### Day 2: 1 May, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Added a couple of finishing touches to the Tribute Page based on advice from FCC forum people. Began to take a look at the Portfolio page project. Looked at other people's work through the forum and made a start on mine. Worked on the navigation bar for the top of the page.

**Thoughts** Found work on the navigation bar to be slow going and somewhat frustrating - to be expected, I expect!

### Day 3: 2 May, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Progressed with Portfolio page; nav bar sorted (some style tweeks remaining), began work on 'about' section and 'portfolio' section.

**Thoughts** More progress made today - not sure about style choices made, but a good start!

### Day 4: 3 May, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Spent some time watching videos about Bootstrap. Progressed with Portfolio page; worked primarily of the main portfolio section, fixing layout, editing 'coming soon' image and 'tribute page' image and putting these in place, along with explanation text. Added buttons for each link, formatting colour of buttons and well backgrounds.

**Thoughts** Steady progress on Portfolio page, layout and colour scheme are pleasing. Going to have to fix the alignment of the Portfolio and Contact Me sections at some point!

### Day 5: 4 May, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Tweeking Portfolio page - resizing fonts and centering sections. Then working on creating some links to social media sites with some buttons that have some kind of animated element. Achieved this for a Twitter button - need to replicate for other sites.

**Thoughts** Steady progress on Portfolio page, made some good use of online resources, particularly solving the alignment issue and then for adding some simple hover over animation for social media link buttons.

DAY MISSED!

### Day 6: 6 May, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Final touches put on Portfolio responsive elements; submitted to FCC forum for feedback. Made a small start of Javascript in FCC.

**Thoughts** Portfolio looking good. Not perfect - will need to come back and work on. Good to make a start on Javascript! Little bit nervous about it!

### Day 7: 7 May, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Started learning about Javascript! Learning about: variables, data types, expressions, operators and arrays.

**Thoughts** Began with FCC but decided to try out a fairly lengthy Javascript fundamentals course on youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMvzfQSI6pQ&t=998s).

### Day 8: 8 May, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Continued watching video about Javascript, learning about decisions and function declarations. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMvzfQSI6pQ&t=998s)

**Thoughts** Building up the Javascript knowledge.

### Day 9: 9 May, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Not a lot! Continued a bit with the 'Code Once' Javascript fundamentals video but it stopped making sense to me! Chose an alternative, shorter video recommended on Twitter by Traversy (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEROU2XtPR8) - will watch next. On FCC, tackled the next few tasks.

**Thoughts** Javascript is tricky!

### Day 10: 10 May, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Continued with the Traversy Javascript video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEROU2XtPR8).

**Thoughts** Javascript is still tricky but going back over the fundamental concepts again has been good. Also, this video works directly with the web browser rather than using Node - different, which is good, plus it feels a little closer to actually creating things for the web.

### Day 11: 11 May, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Continued with the Basic Javascript section of FCC, completing 44 sections. Finished the Traversy Javascript video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEROU2XtPR8).

**Thoughts** A couple of sections on FCC have proven confusing, but mostly this is returning to topics covered in videos watched already. Traversy video was interesting though it lost me towards the end.

### Day 12: 12 May, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Short stint today; completed some more of the FCC challenges in the Basic Javascript section of FCC - 6 completed.

**Thoughts** Looked up the Norwich FCC grouo, which appears largely defunct - my membership request has been ignored but non-members can see messages. I messaged the only guy who has been active this year and said what's going on. Proposed taking it over and he said the guy running it would probably like that. What to do...

### Day 13: 13 May, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: A few more FCC code challenges.

**Thoughts** Tried - briefly - the 30 day Javascript challenge - clearly too tricky at this point!

### Day 15: 15 May, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Started 'Modern Javascript from the beginning' on Udemy. Worked on the fundamentals section, covering variables, data types, conversion of data types, maths, string methods, template literals.

**Thoughts** I like this course, it is very methodical and clear. I'm taking notes this time - hopefully that will help with recollection - I'll be able to refer back if I lose track of the fundamentals when implementing them into more complex code. Also like - on a side note - that it showed me how to set up a 'live server' through Visual Studio Code so that updates are automatically loaded into browser on save.

### Day 16: 16 May, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Cracked on with 'Modern Javascript from the beginning', working on arrays and array methods.

**Thoughts** Still enjoying this course.
