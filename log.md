### Day 1: 30 May, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Started the 'tribute page' project on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've only recently started coding and very recently gotten into FreeCodeCamp. Enjoyed doing the first project and have posted it on the FreeCodeCamp forum for comments (took some time to comment on other people's first).

### Day 2: 1 April, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Added a couple of finishing touches to the Tribute Page based on advice from FCC forum people. Began to take a look at the Portfolio page project. Looked at other people's work through the forum and made a start on mine. Worked on the navigation bar for the top of the page.

**Thoughts** Found work on the navigation bar to be slow going and somewhat frustrating - to be expected, I expect!

### Day 3: 2 April, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Progressed with Portfolio page; nav bar sorted (some style tweeks remaining), began work on 'about' section and 'portfolio' section.

**Thoughts** More progress made today - not sure about style choices made, but a good start!
