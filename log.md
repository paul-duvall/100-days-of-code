### Day 1: 30 May, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Started the 'tribute page' project on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've only recently started coding and very recently gotten into FreeCodeCamp. Enjoyed doing the first project and have posted it on the FreeCodeCamp forum for comments (took some time to comment on other people's first).
