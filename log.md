### Day 1: 30 April, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Started the 'tribute page' project on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've only recently started coding and very recently gotten into FreeCodeCamp. Enjoyed doing the first project and have posted it on the FreeCodeCamp forum for comments (took some time to comment on other people's first).

### Day 2: 1 May, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Added a couple of finishing touches to the Tribute Page based on advice from FCC forum people. Began to take a look at the Portfolio page project. Looked at other people's work through the forum and made a start on mine. Worked on the navigation bar for the top of the page.

**Thoughts** Found work on the navigation bar to be slow going and somewhat frustrating - to be expected, I expect!

### Day 4: 3 May, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Spent some time watching videos about Bootstrap. Progressed with Portfolio page; worked primarily of the main portfolio section, fixing layout, editing 'coming soon' image and 'tribute page' image and putting these in place, along with explanation text. Added buttons for each link, formatting colour of buttons and well backgrounds.

**Thoughts** Steady progress on Portfolio page, layout and colour scheme are pleasing. Going to have to fix the alignment of the Portfolio and Contact Me sections at some point!

### Day 5: 4 May, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Tweeking Portfolio page - resizing fonts and centering sections. Then working on creating some links to social media sites with some buttons that have some kind of animated element. Achieved this for a Twitter button - need to replicate for other sites.

**Thoughts** Steady progress on Portfolio page, made some good use of online resources, particularly solving the alignment issue and then for adding some simple hover over animation for social media link buttons.

DAY MISSED!

### Day 6: 6 May, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Final touches put on Portfolio responsive elements; submitted to FCC forum for feedback. Made a small start of Javascript in FCC.

**Thoughts** Portfolio looking good. Not perfect - will need to come back and work on. Good to make a start on Javascript! Little bit nervous about it!
