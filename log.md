### Day 1: 30 April, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Started the 'tribute page' project on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've only recently started coding and very recently gotten into FreeCodeCamp. Enjoyed doing the first project and have posted it on the FreeCodeCamp forum for comments (took some time to comment on other people's first).

### Day 2: 1 May, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Added a couple of finishing touches to the Tribute Page based on advice from FCC forum people. Began to take a look at the Portfolio page project. Looked at other people's work through the forum and made a start on mine. Worked on the navigation bar for the top of the page.

**Thoughts** Found work on the navigation bar to be slow going and somewhat frustrating - to be expected, I expect!

### Day 3: 2 May, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Progressed with Portfolio page; nav bar sorted (some style tweeks remaining), began work on 'about' section and 'portfolio' section.

**Thoughts** More progress made today - not sure about style choices made, but a good start!

### Day 4: 3 May, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Spent some time watching videos about Bootstrap. Progressed with Portfolio page; worked primarily of the main portfolio section, fixing layout, editing 'coming soon' image and 'tribute page' image and putting these in place, along with explanation text. Added buttons for each link, formatting colour of buttons and well backgrounds.

**Thoughts** Steady progress on Portfolio page, layout and colour scheme are pleasing. Going to have to fix the alignment of the Portfolio and Contact Me sections at some point!

### Day 5: 4 May, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Tweeking Portfolio page - resizing fonts and centering sections. Then working on creating some links to social media sites with some buttons that have some kind of animated element. Achieved this for a Twitter button - need to replicate for other sites.

**Thoughts** Steady progress on Portfolio page, made some good use of online resources, particularly solving the alignment issue and then for adding some simple hover over animation for social media link buttons.

DAY MISSED!

### Day 6: 6 May, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Final touches put on Portfolio responsive elements; submitted to FCC forum for feedback. Made a small start of Javascript in FCC.

**Thoughts** Portfolio looking good. Not perfect - will need to come back and work on. Good to make a start on Javascript! Little bit nervous about it!

### Day 7: 7 May, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Started learning about Javascript! Learning about: variables, data types, expressions, operators and arrays.

**Thoughts** Began with FCC but decided to try out a fairly lengthy Javascript fundamentals course on youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMvzfQSI6pQ&t=998s).

**Link(s) to work**

### Day 8: 8 May, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Continued watching video about Javascript, learning about decisions and function declarations. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMvzfQSI6pQ&t=998s)

**Thoughts** Building up the Javascript knowledge.

**Link(s) to work**

### Day 9: 9 May, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Not a lot! Continued a bit with the 'Code Once' Javascript fundamentals video but it stopped making sense to me! Chose an alternative, shorter video recommended on Twitter by Traversy (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEROU2XtPR8) - will watch next. On FCC, tackled the next few tasks.

**Thoughts** Javascript is tricky!

**Link(s) to work**
1. None.

### Day 10: 10 May, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Continued with the Traversy Javascript video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEROU2XtPR8).

**Thoughts** Javascript is still tricky but going back over the fundamental concepts again has been good. Also, this video works directly with the web browser rather than using Node - different, which is good, plus it feels a little closer to actually creating things for the web.

**Link(s) to work**
1. None.

### Day 11: 11 May, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Continued with the Basic Javascript section of FCC, completing 44 sections. Finished the Traversy Javascript video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEROU2XtPR8).

**Thoughts** A couple of sections on FCC have proven confusing, but mostly this is returning to topics covered in videos watched already. Traversy video was interesting though it lost me towards the end.

**Link(s) to work**
1. None.

### Day 12: 12 May, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Short stint today; completed some more of the FCC challenges in the Basic Javascript section of FCC - 6 completed.

**Thoughts** Looked up the Norwich FCC grouo, which appears largely defunct - my membership request has been ignored but non-members can see messages. I messaged the only guy who has been active this year and said what's going on. Proposed taking it over and he said the guy running it would probably like that. What to do...

### Day 13: 13 May, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: A few more FCC code challenges.

**Thoughts** Tried - briefly - the 30 day Javascript challenge - clearly too tricky at this point!

### Day 15: 15 May, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Started 'Modern Javascript from the beginning' on Udemy. Worked on the fundamentals section, covering variables, data types, conversion of data types, maths, string methods, template literals.

**Thoughts** I like this course, it is very methodical and clear. I'm taking notes this time - hopefully that will help with recollection - I'll be able to refer back if I lose track of the fundamentals when implementing them into more complex code. Also like - on a side note - that it showed me how to set up a 'live server' through Visual Studio Code so that updates are automatically loaded into browser on save.

### Day 20: 20 May, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Progressed onto the section on the DOM in the Javascript course, learning how to examine the document object.

**Thoughts** Still going well though I need to put in a bigger day at some point this week - last few days have been an hour or so commitment per day.

**Link(s) to work**
1. None.

### Day 21-23: 21-23 May, Monday - Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Progressed through the DOM and Events section of course

**Thoughts** Slow and steady! Not doing as much per day as I would like but still moving forward! All making sense, more or less, though event bubbling and delegation a little confusing (though I understand the principle).

**Link(s) to work**
1. None.

### Day 24-30: 24-30 May, Thursday - Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Have completed the DOM / Events section of the Javascript course and have completed the first DOM project. Have also completed a few more FCC Javascript objectives and have been completing a follow along scratch video to learn some fundamentals of producing a game ahead of creating something of my own for CS50 week 0.

**Thoughts** Have slowed down somewhat - hit a bit of a brick wall. Will try to pick it up a bit - have created a schedule of targets to stay on top of.

**Link(s) to work**
1. None.

### Day 31-32: 31 May / 1 June, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Continued having fun learning how to make a game in Scratch for CS50 week 1, completed a few more challenges in the FCC Javascript section.

**Thoughts** Probably need to push ahead and make a simple program in Scratch according to the perameters outlined in project targets. Good to get back into FCC, though want to make sure I go through the next project in the Udemy course as well. FCC update has thrown everything up in the air - there are many new sections now and things have been moved around; will need to decide how to tackle and adjust the target schedule accordingly (this needs to be finished anyway).

### Day 33: 2 June, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Completed Scratch program for CS50.

**Thoughts** Did not intend to spend all programming time today on my Scratch program, but I was enjoying it! Done, moving on in CS50 tomorrow.

### Day 33: 3 June, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Watched first week 1 lecture is CS50 and part of second lecture(which introduced C), coding along and learning how to use the CS50 interface and some command prompt stuff.

**Thoughts** Interesting to see similarities / differences between C and Javascript. Enjoyed the command prompt stuff, also interesting to work with a programming language that needs to be compiled. Will hopefully move on to the week 1 projects tomorrow (and do need to make some time to do either a bit of FCC or the next part of the Udemy course).

### Day 35 - 37: 5 June, Tuesday - 7 June, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Watched the remainder of CS50 week 1, lecture 2. Completed pset1 - Cash and pset2 - caesar.

**Thoughts** Completing these projects is genuinely exciting. Feels like proper coding for the first time - debugging, building up a programme one step at a time, writing pseudo code. A real sense of achievement. I've started logging my coding hours in order to incentivise putting more time in. Have put in 9 hours so far this week. Aiming for (in an ideal world - we shall see) 28! I will log the number of hours achieved each week on a Sunday to see if there is an upward pattern.

### Day 38 - 40: 8 June, Friday - 10 June, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Completed CS50 pset2, second problem (Vigenere) using C. Completed remainder of Javascript basic challenges in Freecodecamp. Started Loan Calculator DOM Project in Javascript: From the beginning.

**Thoughts** The second pset2 problem was tricky and took a good five hours; very rewarding in the end though. Good to get back into some non-CS50 stuff. Will spend the start of the coming week pushing forward with some other stuff before returning to CS50 later in the week.

### Day 43: 14 June, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed week 2 lecture and begun to work on pset3, Music. Completed the 'music writing' part, and wrote code for the rest and duration functions. 

**Thoughts** This problem set involves working with much more complex programmes with multiple interlinked files including specifically created headers. Took some time to go through and work out what everything does and I definitely don't know what everything does!

**Link(s) to work**
1. None

### Day 44: 15 June, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Watched some of the 'short lectures' from week 2, developing understanding of computational complexity (to some degree!), along with different types of sorting algorithms (selection, bubble and insertion sort). Continued work on pset2 - music, working on the frequency algorithm.

**Thoughts** Properly confused by this problem. Very slow going.

### Day 45: 17 June, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Started watching some videos about git.

**Thoughts** Slight change of tack. Learning a bit about git is interesting (and feels like I'm learning something essential) but I know I'll have to get back to that pset problem eventually!

### Day 48: 4 July, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Watched more Git videos, pushing on to GitHub, downloading the GitHub desktop app and actually transferring some changes from a project on my computer to my github! Whoop! Also continued Dylan Israel's video series Code Like a Pro (interesting videos on using a Linter for Javascript - will need to install and experiment with this at some point. Listened to an interesting podcast on Hackathons - investigate if any are happening nearby out of curiosity.

**Thoughts** Have forked an interesting project on Github for beginners looking to make their first commit to a project - will be checking out tomorrow.

### Day 51: 7 July, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Continued working through Modern Javascript from the Beginning - object oriented Javascript section. Learnt about prototypes and prototypical inheritance. Then managed to publish my portfolio site through GitHub pages.

**Thoughts** Will most likely need to review this prototypical inheritance thing again; gradually building a picture of what oop and why I should care! Pleased to have managed to publish my site - need to make the changes that were proposed by FCC forum folk months ago now!

### Day 59: 18 July, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Begun CSS Grid course

**Thoughts** Was planning on doing this eventually but brought it forward following the FCC CSS Grid section and looking at my portfolio page and thinking that perhaps it would work better using CSS Grid!

**Link(s) to work**

### Day 60: 19 July, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Continued CSS Grid course (Wes Bos)

**Thoughts** Course very helpful - definitely developing a better understanding of CSS Grid.

**Thoughts** 

**Link(s) to work**

### Day 65-66: 24-25 July, Tuesday - Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Spent some time working the JS book, reviewing arrays, learning about build in objects, including the window object, the document object, string object, number object, math object, date object. Also read through chapter on decisions and loops and started the chapter on the document object model, reviewing how to select elements using ID attributes and learning about DOM queries that return nodelists.

**Thoughts** Did five hours today and made what felt like a good deal of progress.

**Link(s) to work**

### Day 67: 8 August, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Have done some work over the previous few days - not recording them as I lost track of what I did when! I've revamped by Portfolio, removing bootstrap and implementing Grid / Flexbox. Worked on a number of bugs including contrast issues with text and an issue with the in page links not lining up correctly. Started work on the next project too starting a product page for a company called Snazzy Socks! Continued to read Javascript book.

**Thoughts** Now that I look at the above section, it feels like I've made good progress! Need to dedicate some time to working out responsive issues on portfolio (this, I feel, is key to my progress at the moment). Would be good to get the responsive web design section of freeCodeCamp done and dusted and then I can fully focus on Javascript, using my book and online course but having freeCodeCamp as the central point to ensure I keep moving forward (and actual produce projects!).

**Link(s) to work**

### Day 68: 9 August, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Read a couple of articles on responsive layout (need to finish the second article and keep reading on this subject - lots to learn!). Used what I learnt to keep working on the layout of the Snazzy Socks page - made some decent progress in getting this sorted.

**Thoughts** Hopefully what I've learnt doing the layout of Snazzy Socks will help resolve issues on Portfolio. Need to read article recommended to me on FCC forum about auto-fill / auto-fit.

### Day 69: 10 August, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Continued to work on Snazzy Socks page, adding css for nav section, finishing design and adding form elements to sweetener section and selecting and formatting images for other sections.

**Thoughts** Not long to go now for Snazzy Socks. Might be nice to add a little bit of css interactivity in there on the nav bar or some kind of movement in the trial or options section.

### Day 70: 11 August, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Continued to work on Snazzy Socks page, making changes so that it passes FCC tests, including adding a media query, redoing the logo and making the images responsive.

**Thoughts** Moderate success with the media query. Still gonna have to tackle the response design of my portfolio at some point!

### Day 74: 16 August, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Started the FCC Javascript ES6 section, quickly hit a road block and sidestepped into learning about higher order functions, watching video from Traversy Media - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRgD1yVwIvE.

**Thoughts** Took some time to learn about higher order functions - begun to understand using forEach, map, sort and reduce. Will need to practice some away from video for it to sink in. Also learnt about arrow functions.

**Link(s) to work**
None

### Day 75: 17 August, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Continued with the Javascript ES6 section on FCC

**Thoughts** There are some tricky concepts here and I am taking my time to try and understand them as best I can, making use of other resources to try to properly understand new concepts such as the rest and spread operators and destructuring assignment.

**Link(s) to work**
None

### Day 76: 20 August, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about CSS Animation basics using Traversy Media video then had a little play around. Also started the regular expressions sections of FCC (skipping the remainded of ES6 for the time being).

**Thoughts** Good to start finding out a bit about CSS Animation!

### Day 77: 22 August, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on solving three freeCodeCamp JS algorirthms.

**Thoughts** Took quite a bit of time and had to look at a couple of videos / solutions (however, when I did, I was invariably very close to the solution!). Also spent a bit of time, get a repository set up on github to store algorithm solutions. This in itself felt like a good way to spend my time - using this tool more frequently is defintely a good idea!

### Day 78: 23 August, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Started a new course (why not?) on CSS, first section looking at interesting ways to style buttons. Made a start on going through the Javascript 'memory game' a second time.

**Thoughts** It might seem crazy to start a new course but I like the idea of finding out more about CSS beyond the basics and this Brad Hussey course looks like it will do just that. Will give me something to do when I'm letting my brain off doing more Javascript! Only an hour today though...

**Link(s) to work**

### Day 79: 24 August, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Continued going through the Javascript 'memory game' a second time.

**Thoughts** Spent about 90 minutes working on the above, making notes on the various steps needed to complete the Javascript parts - plan on following these as I attempt to code this on my own soon.

**Link(s) to work**

### Day 80-81: 25-26 August, Saturday - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Finished going through the Javascript 'memory game' a second time. Completed a couple of the CSS3 in 30 Days lesssons, learning about different styles for typography and using clip-path to style the outline of an image. Then completed another Javascript algorithm in FCC

**Thoughts** Wrote lots of instructions for myself for potentially having a go at the memory game without watching the video. Still reckon it will be very difficult! Will give it a go though! Learnt some interesting stuff through the Brad Hussey CCS course. Todays algorithm turned out to be very simple - I spent a good 45 minutes trying to solve it!

### Day 82: 28 August, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Continued working through the Javascript - Regular Expressions section on FCC, rewatched some of the Modern Javascript from the beginning - to do list videos and started to make my own version.

**Thoughts** Involved a lot of looking at the code from the video, but it still felt good to be coding something web-based using Javascript!

### Day 83: 29 August, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Continued to work on FCC Basic Algorithm Scripting, solving 4 algorithms

**Thoughts** Didn't manage to solve any of these without look at a solution, although (and perhaps I am making excuses for myself here!) I was invariably only one step away from solving it or was approaching the final step in not quite the right way.

### Day 85-86: 1-2 September, Saturday - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Spent quite a bit of time setting up a word press blog, registering a domain and arranging hosting. Attempted to push forward my to do list, but pushing the items to the local storage got the better of me. Worked through a nice video about linking JSON objects to html - gonna repeat to create a mini-project.

**Thoughts**

### Day 87: 4 September, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the FCC Javascript Debugging section and started Basic Data Structures. Completed the penultimate algorithm challenge in the Basic Algorithm Scripting section. Wrote two blog posts. Created a Javascript object containing information on a variety of superheroes to use in Javascript object to HTML project.

**Thoughts** Debugging was all stuff I had worked out myself (nice when that happens). The Basic Data Structures section will be review since I've covered these subjects elsewhere. The algortihm I worked on was very tricky but I got there in the end.

### Day 91-92: 8-9 September, Saturday - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Spent more time working on Wordpress, learning to set up a child site but then failing to get prismjs to work. Went through remainder of Javascript Events chapter in book and used Traversy Media course videos to finish up functionality on To do list.

**Thoughts** The whole prismjs thing has been very frustrating; just need to look at the positives - was able to set up a child theme, which I think will be helpful.
